## About Me

I am a frontend web developer focused on building **reliable, maintainable, and user-focused web applications**.  
My primary expertise is in **Angular**, where I work on structured, scalable solutions with clear architecture and clean code.

I enjoy creating **practical tools and browser extensions** that address real-world needs, with an emphasis on usability, performance, and long-term maintainability.
